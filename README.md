Contemporary Trends in Communication Essay "Digital World is more real than the offline version?"

This question has grown its relevancy since the social networks had a boom. The use of this media became revolutionary as it has been proven that helps to the sense of belongness of many people. It provides a platform for those whose tiny voice in the physical world hasn't been heard. This kind of innovation responds to the needs of both, the very specific groups of people and the big picture in society. Innovation is an interactive process, the new product meets the new needs of people and viceversa, the new product evolves because of the participation and use of the consumers (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Vargo and Lusch, 2004; von Hippel, 2005). A new technology and system like social media meets the new need of participation that the human has.

The emergence of social networking sites has created a problem of how the self is to be understood in the online world. 
As these sites are social, they relate someone with others in a network. Thus there seems to emerge a new kind of self which exists in the online world. As the use of online social media has become more widespread, the line between the two kinds of self is becoming fuzzier. Ultimately speaking, both kinds of selves do not have any essence, i.e., any characteristic inherent to them that serves to show that these selves are what they are and none other. Instead an externalist account of the identity of the self is offered that locates the identity in question in the selfâ€™s relations with other selves as well as other events and objects.
